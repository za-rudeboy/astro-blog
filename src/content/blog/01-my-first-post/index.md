Hello world! This is my very first blog post. I don't really have anything interesting to say but, I just wanted to get something out there. Hell, I might not even proofread this before posting. I'm lying — I'll probably ask some or other LLM to proofread it for me before posting.

Rest assured though — this has been written by me. Rudy. An actual human being. Tempting as it may be to get ChatGPT to write a blog post for me 😏
