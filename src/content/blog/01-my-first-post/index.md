Hello world! This is my very first blog post. I don't really have anything interesting to say but I just wanted to get something out there. Hell, I might not even proof read this before posting. I'm lying, I'll probably ask some or other LLM to proof read it for me before posting.

Rest assured though this has been written by me. Rudy. An actual human being. Tempting as it may be to get ChatGPT to write a blog post for me 😏
